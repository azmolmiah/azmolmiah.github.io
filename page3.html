              </h3>
              <p>
                There are many more ways to have been more efficient in making
                this website. One of them being a responsive layout and commonly
                used markup and styling library such as Bootstrap. Using
                Javascript I would have been able to use React with Redux to
                manage components and efficiently use data throughout the
                website without having to repeat components. Also adding
                typescript to the frontend would make managing the website
                easier and free from bugs. I could have used javascript headless
                cms, Django, or the MERN stack to manage data dynamically. These
                make managing a website by assigning components to team members
                very easily. So the drawbacks of HTML and CSS is that they
                provide a static solution which you is very manual, time costly,
                code can become messy and not efficient at all with managing
                data on their own.

                Is to plan the website using the software development lifecycle
                approach. After this create wireframes based on the target
                audience in terms of their use on the website. Design this on
                photoshop or better yet, use sketch which can make it easier to
                visualise the website. Make a base for the website and allocate
                components if there is a team. Learn about other technologies or
                approaches which can help. Use frameworks and create your own
                library of code which you can use again. Use Trello to organize
                your time and tasks. Finally, look into automation for the
                boring stuff.

                I would work in a team that gives the ability to bring different
                ideas and manage workload. Use something like sketch to create
                mockups which also has ability to provide you with code as well.
                Design the whole look of a website on Photoshop. Use something
                like Contentful to make my backend for dynamic content. Use
                React to get more control over components and manage data. Use
                Bootstrap for layout and composition of elements. Use slack with
                Github to share code if working on a team.

                Manual testing would include, using Google's developer tools,
                playing with the browser size to check how responsive the layout
                is, check if everything is displayed the same for every user,
                send messages using the form and keep testing by clicking into
                all links. Using software like Jira or Test Cafe for a more
                dynamic testing.
