              <p>
                For my home page, I have a header section with two columns, the
                column on the left is an introduction about me, my skills, and a
                button to scroll the projects section. The second column on the
                right is an image of a laptop with video overlapping the screen
                to give it the effect of an actual laptop screen. The section
                below is icons with the technologies I have used which are
                sourced from the font-awesome library. within a 4 column layout.
                The last section is a column layout of four projects which has
                an image of the project and a link to the hosted projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                For my outcome pages, I have a header section with two columns,
                the column on the left is an animation of the unit number in
                digits and about me paragraph. The outcomes have been listed in
                a single central column with a pin line running along the left
                side. I have also highlighted the unit questions and the
                reference on hover.
              </p>
              <p>
                The contact page is quite simple with a central form. The input
                fields have basic HTML5 validations and the submit button in
                yellow with a 100% width.
              </p>
              <p>
                For all the pages I have a fixed navigation for ease of
                navigating through the website. The navigations have a
                transition on hover and when on a page highlighted without hover
                transition to indicate the page the user is on. I have a footer
                with copyright attached to it, favicon Icon and unique title in
                the tabs.

                Copyright is the right of an author for any intellectual
                property to be protected from anyone else passing it off as
                their own. In web development, this can be constraints on the
                use of images that show clearly that the name of the owner,
                watermarks, and logos. This can be overcome by asking for
                permission or referencing the owner with permission. The law in
                the U.K. is the Copyright, Designs, and Patents Act 1988. A
                supplemental law, the Copyright (Computer Programs) Regulations
                1992 extends protection to software, which is normally protected
                under laws and agencies unique from copyright. For software, if
                it's free to download it usually means it's free or commonly
                know as opensource and if you have to pay for it then it
                definitely means that it has copyright to it. Copyright can vary
                in different parts of the world.

              <p>
                People with visual impairment have to use specialised software
                and hardware to navigate through websites. One of the most
                commonly known as screen readers. These readers help to provide
                information or navigate a website by reading the alt attribute
                in an image, read icons, menus, and files, etc. Common
                accessibility issues are layout, headings, navigation, Non-HTML
                content, Javascript, Images with no or Inaccurate Alt Tags, and
                poorly-structured forms.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of the issues that people could face are those who have
                visual impairments may need to be able to increase the size of
                your website without distorting and therefore you would need a
                responsive website. They might need to use software like JAWS.
                Any animations which can be very flashy, have videos which are
                flashy could affect those with epilepsy. Any website which has
                loud sounds that can affect those with hyperacusis.

              <p>
                The appropriate file types on the internet are as follows HTML
                which is used for the structure of a website, CSS which is the
                styling of a website, .txt which is just plain text that can be
                used for reading text, pdf for the format is intended to display
                exactly the same way on in any environment and can be included
                in websites for that purpose, markdown files provide information
                about formatting and style of text for the browser to render,
                jpeg, gif, png, SVG, mp3 files for audio and mp4 files for
                video. These are some of the filetypes which are appropriate to
                use on websites.
