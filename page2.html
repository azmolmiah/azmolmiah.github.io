                HTML5 gave to structure my website has made it easy. I am able
                to understand where I should place my content and how to style
                it. With HTML I am able to use external libraries to compliment
                my website such as using CDN's and style sheets to give my
                website a great look. Also being able to add elements such as
                videos and many more.
              </p>
              <p>
                CSS3 has given my website a lot of personality with the use of
                colors, animations, scroll effects, shadow effects, positioning
                elements, and a custom layout.
              </p>
              <p>
                With both technologies above I am able to make a website that
                provides the tools to make the best UI to give the UX. I am very
                happy with how both technologies give you the ability to make a
                static website with so many options.
              </p>

                Also, using VSCode which is free and more than competent when
                compared with premium IDE's. Trello was great for organising the
                project between a team and individually.

              <p>
                Using HTML and CSS of the frontend of a website, with the idea
                of just making it informative is more than appropriate. The
                reason being is that both these tools are used with all other
                programming languages. For example in the frontend, if you were
                to make a dynamic website you would still need to use HTML and
                CSS. Libraries like React use CSS and HTML. So, the reality of
                it is that there is no other replacement for structuring and
                styling the frontend of your website.

                final project
              </h3>
              <p>
                The strengths of my websites are... With UI I have tried to keep
                it clean, balanced in terms of whitespace, animation adds more
                interactive experience to the user, responsive layout using
                media queries with containers and flexbox. With UX I have used
                the scroll to element with id for easier access, big buttons for
                all devices, and the use of sticky navigation for navigating
                through any position of the website.
              </p>
              <p>
                Weakness in this website is the use of a video that is not
                hosted remotely but included in the root folder which can cause
                performance issues. Not being able to use a library like
                bootstrap or Material UI, this makes it difficult to design a
                website for cross-platform as well as being fully responsive and
                takes a lot more time. Without the use of a preprocessor such as
                SCSS, can't extend the standard CSS characteristics by simply
                introducing the benefits of a basic programming language.
                Without a frontend framework like React we are not able to use
                external API's which can provide more functionality to a static
                website such as a headless CMS.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Further improvements to my website would be to make a full-stack
                website or be able to use APIs. This way I would be to make a
                dynamic blog website with an admin backend to include any new
                data, make changes, and delete data. I would implement React
                with Redux to manage the state of data on the frontend, manage
                components of the website easier, and prop drill data. Use SCSS
                for better CSS implementation. Use Bootstrap to make the website
                responsive for all devices.

              <p>
                I have formatted HTML by laying everything out in components. I
                have used nav, section elements to structure my content on my
                website, and nesting elements for more control. With CSS I have
                been able to compliment my HTML by the use of identifying
                elements on the webpage with classes and ids. Provide a robust
                layout for my elements and a feel for user experience. With both
                HTML and CSS I have been able to match the requirements of this
                project. The technologies used to make this static website are
                fit for purpose and efficient as there is no other alternative,
                most browsers only renders HTML and CSS for structuring and
                styling a website.
