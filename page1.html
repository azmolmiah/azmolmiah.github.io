              Requirements: Based on the types of problem’s or needs a company
              has. The best way to find this out is to question the client.
              Research similar websites.Understand the client’s website users
              and customers in general. Planning: Use Trello to show what work
              your doing, have done on what days and optimise work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Software design: Use flowchart to see overview of how code will
              work. Software development: Use GitHub to to save work to a remote
              repository for securing working, deployment, contributions and
              managing codebase. Use Google Chrome browser with Google developer
              tools.

            <p>Testing: Manual test and have others test.</p>

            <p>
              Programming versions can become a risk because the programmer
              releases a new version which may include deprecations and you have
              developed using an older version. Competitor makes a website or
              services which is new and has better features which can catch the
              attention of your customers. A key member leaves you through the
              middle of a project. Security risks like Cyber Security issues
              specifically. Not designed with UI/UX in mind which can make it a
              pain to navigate. Performance slow websites, most people on the
              internet don’t usually have the patience. Not building your
              website according to an industry or production-ready standard,
              this could make you look really amateur. No planning or goal can
              make it hard to know which direction you're headed. Documentation,
              others can’t tell what it’s about, lack of comments on code, and
              messy code.

              Trello has helped with managing teams, setting targets, and
              sharing work. It also helps with workflow and optimization. Github
              is great for managing code, allowing teams to collaborate with
              code, also without messing up the original code with the use of
              branches, forking, pulling, and pushing. Permission, private and
              public repositories. A diagram and record of work committed based
              on date. Raising issues within the code, Git bot helps recognize
              issues in code. Move back and forth with versions of your
              software. Integrate Github on slack and use Github API to
              implement in your website if needed. Use Git bash CLI to manage
              repositories from your command tool.
